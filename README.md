# Fetch Rewards Take-Home Assessment

## I created a React SPA that cointains a form that takes user data and makes a POST request to Fetch Rewards Server

#### Deployed SPA can be found [HERE](https://juan-velazquez-fetch-rewards.herokuapp.com/)

#### If youre going to run this locally, git clone it down to a local folder and remember to run "npm install" to install the dependencies

### Please note:

- I avoided using create-react-app to manually configure Webpack and BabelRC as I believe you can demostate expertise if you can create the app from scratch.
- I also coded a fundemental Express.JS server to show some of my experience in the back-end. It is fairly basic since there wasn't a need for a DataBase but it served me well as I was building the front-end.
- While it might complicate comprehensibility on the server code, I acknowledge ChalkJS is here purely for the colorful fun it provides on the terminal.
- I would like to point out a special notice for the Form component code as I believe it is fairly clean, easy to read, and worthy of employment.
